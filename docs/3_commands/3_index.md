# Commands
This section serves as a reference for all the commands that can be used in a DETO_3D [input script](2.1_input.md). These commands allow the user to set up and control the parameters of optimizations, for instance defining the objectives and boundry conditions of the problem, as well as setting up and running the simulation to be optimized. In many cases these commands incorperate LAMMPS syntax, the user is directed towards the [LAMMPS Manual](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html) for in depth explanation of these. The commands here will provide all the necessary infomation for a user familure with LAMMPS simulations
to begin to run optimizations in DETO.
