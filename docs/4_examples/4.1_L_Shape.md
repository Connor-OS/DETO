In this section, we will delve into a practical and illustrative example that demonstrates the integration of a LAMMPS simulation into DETO_3D. The problem in this section is the L Shape Test, a popular benchmark from the literature, as described in[Ochoa et al.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11831-016-9190-3) Problem 4.5.

In this section we aim to provide users with a step-by-step guide on how to undertake an optimisation problem in DETO_3D, emphasizing key considerations such as setting dimensions, defining the search domain, configuring DETO inputs, establishing simulations with appropriate boundary conditions, specifying optimisation parameters a structures through cost functions, running optimisations and analysing output.

The detailed walkthrough will cover the following key aspects in a systematic order:

[4.1.1 Adding a LAMMPS script](4.1.1_Adding_a_LAMMPS_script.md)

[4.1.2 Configuring DETO Inputs](4.1.2_Configuring_DETO_Inputs.md)

[4.1.3 Constructing a DETO script](4.1.3_Constructing_a_DETO_script.md)

[4.1.4 Running an optimisation and analysing outputs](4.1.4_Running_an_optimisation_and_analysing_outputs.md)

By following this comprehensive worked example, users will gain practical insights into the effective utilization of DETO_3D in conjunction with LAMMPS simulations, empowering them to tackle complex topology optimization challenges with confidence and precision.
