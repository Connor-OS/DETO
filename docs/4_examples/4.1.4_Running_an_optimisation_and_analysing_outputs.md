The script in.Lshape should be run from the command line using

`./deto in.Lshape`

Whilst running DETO will output some useful information to the terminal at each optimisation step such as the objective function and volume fraction.

The output of the optimisation is largely analysed through dump files that can record much more extensive information on the system between each optimisation step. These outputs can be configured in much the same way that slandered LAMMPS dumps can be to track per particle values.

In the example here the line:
`dump     1 all custom 1 ./dump/dump.Lshape id type x y v_shyd v_sdev c_nbond`
is included in the script meaning for all particles at each optimisation step the ID, type, x and y coordinates, hydrostatic and deviatoric stress,and number of intact bonds are recorded.

A typical way to view this dumped information is via the open source visualisation software [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/about/) where particles can be visualised and even colour coded with respect to their properties

By displaying the particle type it is possible to get a straightforward visual representation of the distribution of chi at any stage of the optimisation and on the layout of the optimised structure. For example here the conventional "boot" optimal structure can be seen at step 150 of the optimisation

Other parameters such as stress distribution can be displayed as well giving insight into the location of stress concentrations in the structure such as in this case at the top inner corner of the L.

In addition to per particle dump files DETO will also output a so called thermo file by default called `thermo.objective` that tracks the progression of the defined objective function over the course of the optimisation.

Graphically for this example the objective function is shown bellow
