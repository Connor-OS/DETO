### Description
This command imports a chi map from the file path specified into your optimization. A chi map is required to run any optimisation in DETO as it is a core part of this implementation determining the way 'per atom' properties are allocated by the optimization process. See the [chimap](2.2_chimap.md) page for details of the formating and syntax of the chi map file.

!!! note

	you must include one and only one opt_map_chi command in your simulation.
