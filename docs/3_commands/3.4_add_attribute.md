# add_attribute command
add an attribute to a previously specified simulation writen in LAMMPS syntax
### Syntax
```
add_attribute sim_ID command
```
- sim_ID = ID of the simulation to add the attribute to
- command = any syntactically correct command that can be run by LAMMPS.
 
### Examples
````
add_attribute Sim1	    fix	force force_group addforce 0 -1 0
add_attribute Sim2	    minimize	1.0e-10 1.0e-10 1000 2000
add_attribute Sim3      run 1000
````

### Description
Similar to the [[lammps]] command this command takes as an argument any string that is a correct [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html#) command. These commands are associated with a specific simulation, they make up the body of that simulation. They should be used to set the boundry conditions of the simulation as well as run the simulation.

You should think of these commands as defining the conditions you are intending to optimize for

	you must avoid using "set type" commands here these commands as the optimization process uses types in a special way described in [chi_map](2.2_chimap)
