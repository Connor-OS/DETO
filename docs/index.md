# DETO_3D User Manual

DETO_3D is a multiscale topology optimisation code using the discrete element method. For designing and optimising structures or systems with a focus on descrete behaviours.

### Getting started

The code makes extensive use of LAMMPS objects and syntax therefore the user is directed towards the LAMMPS offical [documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html#) to for a deeper understanding of some of the essential concepts in the operation of DETO_3D however this Manual is intended to provide all the necessary information for operation of the code.
