# DETO3D

This code is currently in devlopment. It is writen in C++ and relies on LAMMPS for it's discrete element simulation and has been designed with the intention of giving the user as much freedom as possible to set up and run there own Topology optimisation using an input script with LAMMPS terminology

When complete it may include:

Clases:
- [ ] Simulation
- [ ] Topology

Simulation types:
- [ ] Minimize
- [ ] Run
- [ ] CSTGS

Optimizations:
- [ ] Monte Carlo (with simulated annealing)
- [ ] Perturbation method
- [ ] Genetic Algorythm
- [ ] Particle swarm

Objectives (any combination of below):
- [ ] per particle
- [ ] local
- [ ] global
- [ ] compute
- [ ] variable
- [ ] min
- [ ] max
- [ ] final
