# chimap file

### Syntax
Two possible syntaxes are available for the chimap

Multi Material

```
num_chi material nchi

PROPERTIES: chi type material properties
...
```
one or more material nchi pairs:
- material = name of a material
- nchi = number of chi values to be specified for the preceding material in the table bellow

followed by:
- PROPERTIES: = Keyword telling DETO to start reading the properties for your chimap this must contain chi, type, and material. Can also contain any other per atom properties that can be set with the LAMMPS [set command](https://docs.lammps.org/set.html)

immediately followed by:
- total number of chi lines of values associated to the properties you have just specified

Single Homogeneous Material

```
num_chi nchi

PROPERTIES: chi type properties
...
```
- nchi = number of chi values to be specified for the optimisation

followed by:
- PROPERTIES: = Keyword telling DETO to start reading the properties for your chimap this must contain chi, and type.

immediately followed by:
- total number of chi lines of values associated to the properties you have just specified

### Example

```
num_chi steel 6 concrete 6

PROPERTIES: chi material type diameter
0.001	steel	1	1
0.2	    steel	2	1
0.4	    steel	3	1
0.6	    steel	4	1
0.8	    steel	5	1
1	    steel	6	1
0.001	concrete	7	0.1
0.2	    concrete	8	0.2
0.4     concrete	9	0.3
0.6	    concrete	10	0.4
0.8	    concrete	11	0.5
1       concrete    12  0.6
```

```
num_chi 2

PROPERTIES: chi type
0.001          1
1	           2
```

### Description
The chimap file is used to prescribe the exact mapping of chi values onto particle types materials and any other per particle properties to be allocated during the optimisation. 

a chimpa file is a necessary component of a DETO run and is called from the main input scriot via the [opt_map_chi](3.5_opt_map_chi.md) command.

TODO: add more description on the use and interactions of chimapfile
