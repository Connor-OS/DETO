# opt_type genetic
this command will select a genetic algorithm for optimisation

### Syntax
```
opt_type genetic pop_size select cross_rate mutation_rate keyword value
```
- genetic: style name of this optimisation type
- pop_size: number of individuals in a single generation of the optimisation
- select: selection method, can be tournement or roulette
- cross_rate: probability of crossover between paretn solutions
- mutation_rate: probability of mutation in a given bit/element
- zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args
- keyword: elitism
```
eletism value = fitest
	fitest = number of fitest solutions to maintain across generations
```

### Examples
```
opt_type genetic tournement 50 0.95 0.01
opt_type genetic roulette 200 0.95 0.01 elitism
```


### Description
This optimisation type will use a genetic algorithm, the algorithm uses a technique inspired by natural selection to perform an efficent exploration of the search space. utilising a technique of selection, cross over, and mutation
