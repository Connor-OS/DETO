# At least three columns titled "chi" and "material" and "type". All column contents must be numerical. For the others the user can specify additional columns that will call a lammps "set" command when the map is loaded and whenever a new chi vector is generated by the optimizer (so see properties in lammps that can be set via the "set" command, e.g. diameter, charge, mass, etc... These should impact the interaction potentials)

num_mat 2 #sparse definition of num_chi does not require any defined material
