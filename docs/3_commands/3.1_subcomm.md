# subcomm command
specify the number of subcomunicators to use for the optimization run.
### Syntax
```
subcomm num_subcomms
```
- num_subcomms = integer value for the number of subcommunicators to use

### Examples
```
subcomm 2
subcomm 6
```

### Description
The code is easily parallelizable using the subcomm command. Certain optimisation algorythms available in DETO generate populations of candidate solutions. Each of these needs to be solved independantly before a design itteration can progress creating an opertunity for parallelization.  Using the subcomm command your processors will be divided accros n subcommunicators each taking a portion of the candidates population to solve. Results are combined to berform the next design update.

As parallelisation is designed to work only in the case of algorythms using populations it will only provide benifit when specifying optimization algorythms  such as Genetic algorythm, Particle swarm, or Monte carlo. It will not provide any benifit and could slow the process down if used with the sensitivity or perturbation methods.
