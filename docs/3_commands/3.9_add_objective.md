# add_objective command
Track a varaible from one of your simulations to be used in the objective function.
### Syntax
```
add_objective    sim_ID objective_name objective_lammps_name
```
- sim_ID = ID of the simulation to add the attribute to
- objective_name = unique identifier for this objective
- objective_lammps_name = name of corresponding variable in simulation this objective is tracking
### Examples
```
add_objective sim1 c1 comp
add_objective udl_beam c2 volfrac
```
### Description
track a property of a simulation in as a performance indicator, in DETO objectives are outputs from simulation runs that are used to evaluate performance of the system. 



you must define them relating to a scaler lammps quantity

you can combine them using the [objective function](3.8_objective_function.md)
