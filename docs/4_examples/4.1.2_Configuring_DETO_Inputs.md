The parameter chi can vary throughout an optimisation in DETO of each particle. Chi represents the proportional intensity of the interactions with a particle and can take a value between zero and one. Zero being non-existent particle that has no interactions with neighbours, an one being a particle with penalised interactions with neighbours, see [1] for a more detailed explanation of this parameter.

in DETO chi is specified to be selected from a list of discrete possibilities for each particle, this importantly links each value of chi with a specific LAMMPS particle type, that will be linked to the intensity of interaction potentials. This is done in a so called [chi map](2_running/2.2_chimap.md). A chi map must be included in a DETO optimisation and must include at least three columns chi, material, and type. For this example the basic chi map bellow is used featuring 1 material and 11 chi values.

`chi_map.dat`

```
#chimap generated with input_gen.py

num_mat 1

PROPERTIES: chi material type
0.001 homo 1
0.1 homo 2
0.2 homo 3
0.3 homo 4
0.4 homo 5
0.5 homo 6
0.6 homo 7
0.7 homo 8
0.8 homo 9
0.9 homo 10
1.0 homo 11
```

Complementary to the Chi map defined above is the [potential file](2_running/2.3_potfile.md) which links the defined particle types and therefore chi values to the intensity of particle to particle interactions. This is done by defining individual unique interactions between each potential combination of chi values this means that the number of potentials to be defined needs to be $$\frac{n!}{k!(n−k)!}$$ Where n is the number of chi values specified plus one. If additional atom types are included that are not associate to a chi and therefore static this number increases again. As can be seen this can become a very long file even with a relatively low number of chi values.

In this example since only 11 chi values where used with one static type the number of unique interactions was 78.

The structure of this file will vary heavily depending on the types of interaction included in the simulation, but here the file follows the pattern of:
- defining a group associated with each type
- defining a bond coefficient for each interaction
- creating bonds of the correct type between each type and using the defined coefficients
- deleting the groups so that they can be re-created once the particle types change in the next iteration.
